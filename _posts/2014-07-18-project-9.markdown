description: <b>Motivation&#58;</b>  Quantum dynamics (QD) studies the time-dependence of physical observables. It is an efficient method to do spectroscopy such as infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.<Br> <b>Goal of the tutorial&#58;</b> Understand the theory behind DFT as well as their implementation in software packages.<Br> <b> What are we going to learn&#58;</b><Br> * How to compute the required integrals involving the exchange-correlation potentials via numerical quadratures.<Br> * Implementation of several well-known exchange and correlation functionals.
