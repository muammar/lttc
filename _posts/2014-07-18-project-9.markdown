description: <b>Motivation&#58;</b>  Quantum dynamics (QD) studies the time-dependence of physical observables. It is an efficient method to do spectroscopy such as infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy.<Br> <b>Goal of the tutorial&#58;</b> Goal of the tutorial&#58; Implementation of the code that calculates an energy eigenvalue spectrum by propagating a wave packet in two types of potential&#58; a harmonic potential and a symmetric double-well potential.<Br> <b> What are we going to learn&#58;</b><Br> * Propagating a wave packet in time by solving the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation.<Br> * Using fast Fourier transformations to evaluate operators in reciprocal space.<Br> *Calculating spectra by Fourier transformation of time-dependent expectation values.
