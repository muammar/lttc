description: <b>Motivation&#58;</b> Hartree-Fock theory is the cornerstone of quantum chemistry and most of the correlated methods employ Hartree-Fock orbitals and energies as starting point. Therefore, it is important to know how the theory can be applied in practice.<Br> <b>Goal of the tutorial&#58;</b>  In this tutorial you will learn how to implement the Hartree-Fock-Roothaan equations.<Br> <b> What are we going to learn&#58;</b><Br> * How to express the Hartree-Fock equations in a basis set..<Br> * Implementation of the Roothaan equations in a computer code.
