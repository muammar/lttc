description: <b>Motivation&#58;</b> Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are probabilistic approaches for solving the Schr√∂dinger equation. They provide a very high accuracy, and are among the few methods in the field of quantum simulations that can fully exploit massive parallelism.<Br> <b>Goal of the tutorial&#58; </b> Compute the *exact* energy of H2 with Diffusion Monte Carlo.<Br> <b> What are we going to learn&#58;</b><Br> * To compute the energy without integrals.<Br> * How to perform an efficient stochastic sampling with Variational Monte Carlo. <Br> * How to implement a Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm. <Br> * Embarrassingly parallel workloads.
