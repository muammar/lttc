description: <b>Motivation&#58;</b> The determination of the electronic structure properties of any (nano)-materials requires the use of periodic boundary conditions. The use of Bloch theorem is thus central in this respect, usually combined with various schemes to determine the band energies (tight-binding, DFT, ...).<Br> <b>Goal of the tutorial&#58;</b>Write a code in Python environment to solve the 1D Tight-Binding Model numerically, then explore the different possibilities offered by the existing Tight-Binding implementation in PythTB code, in various dimensionality (0D, 1D, 2D and 3D), and discuss the electronic band structures. <Br> <b> What are we going to learn&#58;</b><Br> * Solving the Schr√∂dinger equation in a periodic potential by using the Bloch theore.<Br> * Building, visualizing numerical electronic structures in various situations, and extracting physical electronic properties (Berry phase, ...).
